    <h1>Privacy Policy for PyMate</h1>
    <p class="update-date">Effective Date: December 15, 2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how LeMillion Labs collects, uses, and discloses your personal data when you use our Python learning mobile application, "PyMate".</p>

    <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect the following personal and non-personal data necessary for the proper functioning and security of the App and to provide premium services.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Email Address:</strong> Collected during account registration and used for account identification, login, password recovery, and communication.</li>
        <li><strong>Account Status (Boolean Flag):</strong> We store a true/false status to determine if your account has paid for and unlocked the premium lessons. This is used solely for core app functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>Progress Data:</strong> Information regarding lessons completed, scores achieved, and last logged-in time. Used solely to maintain and synchronize your learning progress across devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Identifiers and Usage Logs:</strong> Information automatically collected by our third-party authentication and hosting services (e.g., IP address, device type, crash logs) for security and maintenance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>We use the collected data for the following primary purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To **Provide Core Services** and App Functionality (logging in, tracking progress).</li>
        <li>To **Process Premium Access** (checking the boolean flag after payment verification).</li>
        <li>To **Maintain Account Security** and prevent unauthorized access.</li>
        <li>To **Communicate** with you regarding your account or security updates.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services (Data Sharing)</h2>
    <p>We rely on the following third-party services which may process or store your data:</p>
    
    <h3>A. Firebase (Authentication, Hosting, and Database)</h3>
    <p>We use Google's **Firebase** platform to securely handle user authentication and host our database (including your email and progress data). Firebase collects data such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Email address and securely hashed passwords.</li>
        <li>Device identifiers and usage metadata for crash reporting and security.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Paystack (Payment Processing)</h3>
    <p>When you purchase premium access, the transaction is handled by **Paystack**. We **do not** collect or store your sensitive financial data (credit card numbers, bank details). That information is collected directly and securely by Paystack.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We share transaction details (e.g., your Email and the purchase amount) with Paystack to verify your payment and update your account status.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Retention and Security</h2>
    <p>We retain your data as long as your account is active. We take reasonable measures, including relying on Firebase's security protocols (like encryption-in-transit via SSL/HTTPS), to protect your personal data from unauthorized access.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Your Rights and Contact Information</h2>
    <p>You have the right to request access to or deletion of your personal data. If you wish to exercise these rights or have questions about this policy, please contact us:</p>
